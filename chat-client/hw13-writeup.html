           My chat app has two main new features, which are inserting LaTeX equations, and
           sending code with syntax highlighting. With most existing chat applications, to accomplish
           these goals, users usually had to use third-party applications, or send LaTeX/code without
           formatting, and my chat app is solving that problem.

            I had to make slight adjusments to my design. I originally planned for it to be possible
            to send inline code with highlighting inside regular messages, however it turned out to be
            too complicated to implement it. So now the only way to send code is via insert code button,
            and I tried to make this method as usable as possible.
