        <p>
           My chat app will have two main new features, which are inserting LaTeX equations, and
           inserting code with syntax highlighting. My design has not changed signifincantly from 
           the Figma mockup, and it will consist of two ways of sending code/LaTeX: directly from the
           message input text with special formatting, or via insert button. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For this week, I completely implemented sending the LaTeX, which I think is a good halfway point
            as it is one of the two main features.
            I implemented it by using the MathJax plugin. The design is simple: 
            the LaTeX messages are the same as regular messges.
            As long as a message is formatted correctly for LaTeX it will be renedered for it.
            In addition, I added feature for detecting LaTeX in your message and showing preview if it is detected.
