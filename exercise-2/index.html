    <h1>New features of the chat app</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Read receipts</h2>
        <p>
          I made all read receipts public(but the option to make it private
          could be added). For channel based chats, only the number of people is
          displayed on the page since it would make the page too cluttered to
          display all users, however the user list can be viewed when you hover
          over the number of people. For private messaging, there is only one
          user whose read receipts are relevant, so message has either Seen/Not
          seen written below it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Replies</h2>
        <p>
          Replies are not too relevant to my new features, but since main novel
          feature my app is for sending pieces of code, it would make more sense
          that replies are shown as a separate thread for each message, since
          all the replies for each piece of code would be in the same place.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Profile picture</h2>
        <p>
			Profile pictures are displayed in a small circular frame next to each message.
			They can be changed in the Edit profile option, where an enlarged version of the photo is shown.
        </p>
    </ul>
